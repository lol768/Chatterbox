Chatterbox
==========

*Minecraft chat that works for you.*

Chat plugins are nothing new. In the Bukkit scene, there are tons of different plugins, approches, and varying levels of code quality. Every plugin was developed with a different set of needs in mind, and that leads to a lot of fragmentation.

Chatterbox is a new plugin designed around flexibility. If you need a chat plugin that you can just throw onto your server and forget, welcome to the party! If you're a control-freak admin who would love to control every aspect of your chat formatting, it's great to have you on board.

Chatterbox: the chat plugin for every server, every need, and everyone. Be excited â€” we certainly are.
